      Last weekend, I embarked on what would become <strong>the most challenging climb of my life</strong> - scaling Mount Everest!

      <del>Actually, it was just the local hill, but let me dream!</del>

    </p>

    <p>

      The temperature at the base was <b>25째C</b>, but as we climbed higher, it dropped to <mark>just 10째C</mark>! Our guide taught us that each

      CO<sub>2</sub> molecule can trap 10<sup>3</sup> times more heat than oxygen.

    </p>

    <p>

      <i>The wind whistled through the trees as we ascended</i>, carrying the sweet scent of pine needles. Our guide mentioned that this trail was

      <ins>recently renovated for safety</ins>.

    </p>

    <p>

      When preparing for the climb, I made sure to bring my <big>essential survival gear</big>. The most important items were my trusty compass and

      plenty of water. <small>Safety always comes first in mountaineering!</small>

    </p>

    <p>

      Distance covered: 5 kilometers<br />

      Time taken: 3 hours<br />

      Elevation gained: 500 meters
